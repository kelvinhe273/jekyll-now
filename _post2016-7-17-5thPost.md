### What did you do this past week? ###
This week we implemented what I would say the main meat of the project - gathering data from API's, data scraping, and implementating dynamic links within our database website. It was very stressful but very rewarding as well. I feel like I learned a lot about what it takes to build a website by working on every part of it. We started learning about Java which surprised me a little but I'm glad Professor Downing taught us about the importance of using abstract methods and the refactoring process as a whole. Learning about refactoring was interesting enough to make me consider if refactoring could be a career in itself; which was an amusing thought to play around with.

### What's in your way? ###
There's not much really in my way because I feel like the website is basically finished. All our group has to do is have the finishing touches and then prepare to present our website to the rest of the class which shouldn't be that difficult. I feel the most difficult phase of the project was the second phase so now that it's over with the only thing I really have to focus on are the in-class quizzes and the upcoming final.

### What will you do next week? ###
By next week I will want to review the material we have learned up to this point and continue to keep up the readings to make sure I am prepared for the quizzes. I was a little discouraged when I dropped the ball on one of the quizzes last week but the only thing I can do now is just continue to try my best.

If you haven't been living under a rock, you've probably heard of Pokemon Go. John Hanke is the CEO of Niantic, a virtual reality company that teamed up with Nintendo to create this craze. He's also a Texas alumni so I thought this article was pretty interesting.
