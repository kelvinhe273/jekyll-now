### Describe your experience in this class. ###

Wow. The nine weeks went by quickly like a blur, and now I'm almost at the finish line. I just finished presenting the website my group spent the last three weeks trying to build up, and now it's all over, which is a big sigh of relief. Presenting made me realize I still have to work on public speaking. 

Looking back at the nine weeks, I'm surprised at how much we've covered in such a short amount of time. I had no knowledge of Python coming into this class, but now I can leave the class with both the knowledge and appreciation of a very powerful language. I'm also very excited to use the knowledge of building a website to build my own website as soon as this class is over with! 

I'm very grateful that Professor Downing introduced us to many tools without much guidance, because I know in the real world, the ability to learn new thing quickly is a very important asset to have. I also really appreciated the papers he assigned us to read, which I don't think are very relevant to the class, but they are very relevant to a computer science career and gave me a view of the bigger picture. This class reignited my excitement for computer science again, unlike Operating Systems, which discouraged me a little. Although Software Engineering was challenging, it was a challenge I embraced because I saw the value of all the things we were learning. 

For me, the highlights of the class were learning about Extreme Programming, APIs, Parivdea Solutions/Atlassian, the importance of communication within a team, and the various jewels of knowledge given by the papers. If you're a student considering taking this class, I would definitely suggest you take it. Even though it is challenging, it is definitely rewarding because you will leave the class with a better sense of how computer science works in the real world and an abundance of tools to use at your disposal.
