### What did you do this past week? ###
This week I took the midterm and began to work on my internet
database with my group. The midterm sort of caught me off guard.
I thought I was well prepared for it but I definitely panicked a little during the test. We also received a talk from Pariveda Solutions. It was interesting to be able to see what tools they used and their business model, which they emphasized as being a
"generalist" IT company.

### What's in your way? ###
The thing that is in my way would be this project due on Tuesday. I get stressed trying to figure out how to use these various tools with very minimal guidance. This upcoming week is
also the final week of my security class so I know my schedule
will be very tight.

### What will you do next week? ###
By next week I hope to fully understand how API's work as well as learn more about the backend side of web development.

#### Tip-of-the-week: ####
Communicate with your team. This is so important.
