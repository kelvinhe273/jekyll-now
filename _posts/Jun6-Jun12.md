## Jun 6 - Jun 12 ##


### What did you do this past week? ###
This week was my first official week in software engineering and the workload was already intense but enriching. Out of the four papers assigned to us, I found the papers about college advice and collegiate happiness very interesting. The one thing that both of the papers stressed, as well as Professor Downing, was the importance of writing. I wasn’t always the biggest fan of writing because I’m a logical-minded person, and hey, let’s face it, as a programmer I’d rather be writing in code than in English. But I see the importance of it and being able to express myself through written word can be trained through writing this blog.


### What's in your way? ###
What is kind of discouraging is that I was prepared for every class because I read through all the assigned readings, but I still have not gotten a perfect score on any of the daily quizzes. I think the amount of time we are allotted to finish the quizzes is a little too short but maybe I just need to get better at retaining the information I read. Working with all these new development tools is a little challenging as well but I’m glad I’m getting exposure to it. A little embarrassing, but it took me like two hours just to fully understand how branching and merging worked on git.

### What will you do next week? ###
I will focus on retaining information better for the assigned readings. I plan on changing up the way I read and take notes by highlighting the passages as I go by. I’ll also make sure I reread any passages that were not 100% clear to me. I want to also learn more about Python because I can see how empowering the language can be.

Sitting in class is enjoyable because I know that I will learn a lot every time I walk into the class. Downing is very informative and down-to-Earth. He seems to know how the computer science industry works and I already know his class will challenge us to prepare us for the industry. I asked him on his opinion of taking two other classes alongside software engineering and he simply said “you’re crazy”. I thought it was funny in the back of my head and took his advice to drop one of my classes. I valued this class over a simple government class, hopefully I won’t regret my choice.

#### Tip-of-the-week: ####
Get to know people in your class. I already know it’s going to be a tough ride but it makes a little more bearable when you struggle through it together. If you’re a classmate reading this let me know I’m always happy to make new friends. We’re in it together.
